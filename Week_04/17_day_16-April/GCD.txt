Input: 2 positive numbers
Procedure: Euclaid algorithm
Output: greatest common divisor = GCD

Test cases / Examples:
=======================
Input: -1 / 2
Expected result: error message after validation

Input: 4 / 0
Expected result: error message after validation

Input: 2 / 2
Expected result: 2

Input: 40 / 16
Expected result: 
#1 % #2
========
40 % 16 = 8
16 % 8 = 0
8 GCD

16 % 40 = 16
40 % 16 = 8
16 % 8 = 0

Input: 2.7 / 4.5
Expected result: error message after validation


Procedure
===========
Start
    Initialize firstNumber = 0;
    Initialize secondNumber = 0;
    Initialize GCD = 0;
    Initialize Remainder = 0;

    Prompt for firstNumber with "Please put in your first positive integer";
    Prompt for secondNumber with "Please put in your second positive integer";

    Validate that firstNumber and secondNumber are positive integers;

    //Modulo Calculation of GCD
    Loop until Remainder = 0
        firstNumber % secondNumber = Remainder;
        If Remainder == 0
            GCD = secondNumber;
            End Loop;
        Else
            firstNumber = secondNumber;
            secondNumber = Remainder; 
        End
    End
    //would be a do while loop with condition at the end

    Display as "The greater common divisor of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is " + GCD;
End
